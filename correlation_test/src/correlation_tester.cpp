{
    // === TASK 1: Read CSVs into StockData objects ===
    // For each of the 10 CSV files, read raw adjusted close prices, compute log prices,
    // and store them into StockData objects containing dates, raw_prices, log_prices.

    // === TASK 2: Align dates across all stocks ===
    // Build a master set of common dates that exist across all 10 stocks.
    // Use set intersection to ensure perfect alignment of dates.
    // After alignment, extract the corresponding raw_prices and log_prices for each stock.

    // === TASK 3: Calculate per-stock statistics on raw prices ===
    // For each stock's raw_prices vector:
    // - Compute mean, variance, standard deviation, IQR, and spread (range).
    // - Output these statistics into a .txt file.

    // === TASK 4: Calculate log returns for each stock ===
    // For each stock's aligned log_prices vector:
    // - Compute log returns by subtracting previous day's log price.
    // - Store log returns for correlation calculations.

    // === TASK 5: Compute Pearson correlation for all stock pairs ===
    // Loop through all 45 unique stock pairs:
    // - For each pair, compute Pearson correlation using their log returns.
    // - If absolute correlation >= 0.7, consider this pair valid for cointegration.

    // === TASK 6: Run linear regression on valid pairs using log prices ===
    // For each valid pair:
    // - Compute beta, alpha, and residuals from the regression of log prices.
    // - Export the results into a CSV file with columns: Date, Stock1 Price, Stock2 Price, Residual.

    // === TASK 7: Complete program and wrap up ===
    // Ensure all files are properly closed, and print any summary or status messages.
